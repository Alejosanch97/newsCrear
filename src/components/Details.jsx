            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Homework and studying are essential parts of student life. While some students may not always enjoy them, they play a big role in helping learners understand new topics, prepare for tests, and become responsible individuals. Doing homework and reviewing lessons at home is more than just a task—it’s an important habit that leads to better academic results and a deeper understanding of subjects.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">From elementary school to high school, students are expected to practice what they learn in class. Homework reinforces learning and gives students time to think about what they studied during the day. It helps them discover their doubts, practice key concepts, and develop skills like time management, independence, and responsibility.</p>
            <h3 class="details-page-heading">📚 Reinforcing Knowledge Outside the Classroom</h3>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Learning doesn’t end when the school bell rings. Homework allows students to continue the learning process at home. By solving problems, reading, or writing at home, students can strengthen what they learned in class and improve their memory. When students review lessons regularly, they are more likely to retain information and feel confident during exams.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">For example, practicing math problems at home can help students better understand formulas. Reading stories or articles improves vocabulary and reading comprehension. Writing essays allows them to express their thoughts more clearly and develop writing skills.</p>
            <h3 class="details-page-heading">📝 Studying Smart: Preparing for Exams</h3>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Exams are a part of every student’s academic journey. Studying helps students prepare and feel ready for these challenges. Without proper study habits, even intelligent students can struggle in tests. Studying regularly reduces stress, improves focus, and leads to higher scores.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Students who study a little bit every day often perform better than those who try to memorize everything the night before. This method, called "spaced repetition," helps the brain absorb and store information more effectively. Creating flashcards, reviewing class notes, and testing oneself are great techniques to study smarter, not harder.</p>

            <h3 class="details-page-heading">⏳ Building Discipline and Responsibility</h3>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Doing homework regularly also helps students develop important life skills. Time management is one of them. Knowing how to plan time between school, homework, and personal activities is a valuable skill for the future. Completing homework on time teaches responsibility and builds confidence in students’ abilities.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Additionally, when students complete their tasks without being reminded, they feel proud of their work. It teaches them the value of consistency and discipline. These are skills that not only help in school but also in future jobs and everyday life.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">

            <h3 class="details-page-heading">🎯 Conclusion: Strong Habits Lead to Strong Results</h3>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Homework and studying are not just tasks from teachers—they are tools for success. When students make these practices part of their routine, they gain more than good grades. They become more organized, confident, and prepared for the future.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">So remember, even a few minutes of homework or review each day can make a big difference. Good habits today build great achievements tomorrow!</p>

            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Vacations are more than just free time. For students, they provide a much-needed break from academic pressure and allow time to recharge mentally, emotionally, and physically. Rest is a vital part of the learning process, and taking time off can actually improve focus, motivation, and performance once school resumes.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">In our busy academic routines, students often feel overwhelmed by homework, projects, and exams. This constant pressure can lead to stress and even burnout. Vacations offer the opportunity to relax, explore new interests, and spend quality time with family and friends—activities that contribute to a balanced and healthy lifestyle.</p>
            <h3 class="details-page-heading">🌞 Mental and Emotional Recharge</h3>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Resting the brain is as important as exercising it. Vacations give students time to step away from responsibilities and allow the brain to process information learned during the semester. Breaks help reduce anxiety, improve mood, and refresh energy levels. A well-rested student is more likely to return to school with better attention and a positive attitude.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Taking time off also strengthens emotional health. Being free from deadlines and performance pressure allows students to enjoy the present moment, reflect on their experiences, and set new personal goals.</p>

            <h3 class="details-page-heading">🏕️ Building Life Skills Through Free Time</h3>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Vacations aren’t just about doing nothing—they’re a chance to grow in different ways. Students can take up hobbies, travel, read, or even help at home. These experiences build creativity, responsibility, and confidence.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Learning outside the classroom is just as valuable. For example, helping plan a family trip can teach organization and budgeting. Reading for fun improves language skills. Playing sports or music develops discipline and perseverance.</p>
            <h3 class="details-page-heading">💡 A Balanced Life = Better Learning</h3>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Rest and learning go hand in hand. When students return to school after a vacation, they tend to be more focused, motivated, and enthusiastic. Their minds are clearer, and they are better prepared to absorb new knowledge.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">By recognizing the value of rest, schools and families can support students in building healthy habits that will benefit them throughout their lives. Encouraging rest and recreation is not a waste of time—it’s a wise investment in well-being and future success.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">So, take that break, enjoy your time, and come back stronger. Because rest is not just a pause—it's part of the process.</p>

        <p class="details-page-paragraph">Hello guys, how are you, i know that many of you play this sport even if you don´t know many important things and aspects about it.</p>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">Believe me, it is very difficult for me to cover and explain everything about this beautiful sport, it would even be impossible for me to teach you how to play very well, but just read this article and get some information that can help you improve a little bit.</p>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">First of all, Table tennis is much more than hitting a ball with a racket. It's a sport of quick reflexes, concentration, and strategy. Every point is a mental and physical battle.</p>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">Table tennis also requires a good physical and mental preparation. Professional players train for hours to improve their technique, reaction time, and concentration. Matches may seem short, but they require intense effort and a great deal of tactical intelligence.</p>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/18/72/1c/18721c19219fc5d5c032cc7817644863.jpg" alt="Table tennis shots" class="details-page-in-article-image" loading="lazy" />
        <h3 class="details-page-heading">Basic Table Tennis Shots</h3>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">Drive (flat shot or attack shot)</p>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">This is one of the most common shots. It is performed by pushing the ball forward with the paddle slightly tilted. It can be performed with a forehand drive (forehand drive) or a backhand drive (backhand drive).</p>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">Ideal for keeping the ball in play at medium speed.</p>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4e/b7/b7/4eb7b7f103f9e0e73bcbc67154443a19.gif" alt="Table tennis shots" class="details-page-in-article-image" loading="lazy" />
        <h3 class="details-page-heading">Topspin</h3>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">This is an offensive shot that causes the ball to spin forward (top spin). When hitting, the paddle is moved from bottom to top. This causes the ball to bounce and rise quickly, making it difficult for the opponent to respond.</p>
        <h3 class="details-page-heading">Backspin (chop)</h3>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">This is a defensive shot that spins the ball backward (slice). This is performed by moving the paddle from top to bottom. This causes the ball to drop quickly when bouncing, making it difficult for the opponent to attack.</p>
        <h3 class="details-page-heading">Block</h3>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">This is a technique for returning a fast ball without hitting hard. The paddle is placed firmly in front of the ball. It's very useful for defending against an opponent's topspin and returning with control.</p>
        <h3 class="details-page-heading">Serve</h3>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">This is the shot that starts each point. It can have different effects: flat, with topspin, with backspin, or with sidespin. A good serve can confuse your opponent and give you an advantage from the start of the point.</p>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">Today, table tennis is played all over the world, both recreationally and competitively. Countries such as China, Japan, Germany, and South Korea have a long tradition in this sport. In Latin America, nations such as Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia have had important representatives in international tournaments.</p>

        <h3 class="details-page-heading">Why are basic strokes important?</h3>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">Mastering the basic strokes is essential for any player, whether beginner or professional. These strokes allow you to control the ball, maintain the rhythm of the game, and build strategies for attacking or defending. Each stroke has a specific function and is used depending on the match situation.</p>
        <h3 class="details-page-heading">Fun Facts</h3>
        <p class="details-page-paragraph">In professional table tennis, the ball can spin up to 150 times per second with a good topspin! Some players use spin combinations to deceive their opponents, such as double-spin serves (for example, backspin and sidespin at the same time). Although it may seem like an easy sport because of the small table, reflexes must be almost as fast as in boxing!</p>

            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Have you ever been walking along the street and you have seen someone with a dirty and old cap and you have felt that you are in danger?</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Do you think that if that person wasn’t wearing that cap, you have felt more comfortable?… This kind of caps have a history behind that extravagant appearance.</p>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3e/7b/a9/3e7ba9c850a1c5abec12709ec437d40e.jpg" alt="Person wearing a vintage cap" class="details-page-in-article-image" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">A lot of people wear caps in order to protect them of the sun, because they are sports team supporters, to make it outfit looks much better or only keeping an eye because the designs, brand or style.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">However, since 80’s until our days has showed up the vintage cap movement. People who love the classic style, ‘’treasure hunters’’ as they call themselves. This movement consists in a retro collection as any other collection, with the feature that those caps belong to sport teams, universities, athletes and cartoons. Which ones had a boom in 80’s and 90’s.</p>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c3/55/53/c355539bee098bc398b61816dace0d1b.jpg" alt="Collection of vintage caps" class="details-page-in-article-image" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Do you have any idea where these caps come from? Despite many people think these caps are manufactured just in the USA, they are kind of wrong. Cause maybe you don’t think so but they were also produce in South Korea, Philippines, Taiwan and other Asian countries.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">These caps had a remarkable starting due to they became popular when famous people such as athletes and rappers started wearing them, also hockey, American football, basketball and baseball supporters started to wearing them. Through this Americans sports and hip-hop references and even salsa’s singers this culture started to became popular in Colombia. Here people have give them a mayor value, here in Colombia there are different ways to get this caps.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">One of the most popular are ‘’Tranzas’’ or bartering, you can do it in special events where collectors take their collections in order to promote this culture or selling them. There also another way to get this caps through specialized groups in Facebook. Or in Bogotá, you can find them in the 7th career near to cultural center or in San Victorino there you can buy them or make bartering.</p>
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">So many people asks. Why this caps are so expensive? Or how people give them the commercial coast? By being a collectable article, the most important thing to have in the radar is the veracity, that the caps are original. Instead there are exceptions such as ‘’Aguilas’’ them were originally manufactured by Nike, but South Korea fabrics started making not official copies, I mean not original with sports teams, even so in our days, these costs around 300.000 Colombian pesos or more. There also some caps are made of wool or leather, having similar or more coast, without having into count that all of them are embroiled in thread.</p>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d6/b6/f3/d6b6f3f78ee89cf35f4ebbba9fb26424.jpg" alt="Collectors and their vintage caps" class="details-page-in-article-image" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="details-page-paragraph">Other of the one most important thing to have in count about the high prices about these collection is the antiquity and how they are cared or conserved, by the way you can make them a restorations or how the collectors says ‘’give them love’’ and if they are easy to get, sometimes when a celebrity have wearied a cap it makes it more expensive or some caps weren’t manufactured in many units, that also make them more expensive, one of these can coast more than 800.000 COP.</p>
            <h3>IMPORTANT FACTS</h3>
            <ul>
             <li>Caps commercial names can change through years or collectors. For example, before ‘’Destellos’’ they were ‘’Colisiones’’ and ‘’Electrocardiograma’’ is also called ‘’onda de choque’’.</li>
             <li>In Colombia, these caps are one of the most stolen articles due to their value.</li>
             <li>Collectors promote a code of respect among themselves and amateurs.</li>
             <li>This cap culture has also been mixed with vintage jumpers and jerseys.</li>
